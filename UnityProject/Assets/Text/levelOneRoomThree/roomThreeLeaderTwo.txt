But I do know of the janitor around this area. He is more familiar with the forest than I am, I think he can help you.
By the way, what is the time on your watch? The janitor may be leaving soon for his break. He is a lazy guy. Once he leaves, he may slack off and never come back for his next shift.
The janitor will leave at 6 o' clock. Let's hurry up and get him. I think we will be able to get him if we start looking for him now.
