This is the city of my planet.
It is right now not in the best conditions but my people are joining to help rebuild it.
Some of your human from Earth invaded our planet 100 years ago... well, the past is in the past.
Could you help me clean up the trash here? There is only worthless garbage around here... But you may find something useful to rebuild your ship.
I have to go soon for my meeting with others. However, it seems i have misplaced my talking device somewhere...I need that to call the others...
